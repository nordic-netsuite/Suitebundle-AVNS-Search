# Suitebundle-AVNS-Search
AVNS Search is Built in SuiteScript 1.0. A newer solution is built in suitescript 2.0 called ADO Search.<br>
This document describes how to use the AVNS Search functionality. AVNS Search is a method to be used by external systems to get information from Netsuite by calling a REST-function. Head components in the system are Saved Searches and a script that describes the implementation of the REST-function. A Saved Search defines what record type to get from the system and may also contain one or more filters to reduce the number of results. The Saved Search also describes what fields to be read on the record<br><br>
The REST-call can contain additional filters to further reduce the number of results.
